# Assignment
Hey There ,, This repository Called Assignment is created for my college assignment of Data Structure which consist of a report and powerpoint presentation . Which is created by my team members and myself
Our Topic for Assignment is Hashing and collision .
Hashing and Collision Resolution
Overview:
Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science used to efficiently store and retrieve data in various applications such as databases, password storage, and cryptography. It involves mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, typically for faster access and retrieval.

Hashing:
Hashing functions take an input (or 'key') and produce a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash value or hash code. This process is deterministic, meaning the same input will always produce the same hash value. Hash functions are designed to be fast to compute.

Collision:
Collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash value. This can lead to data loss or inconsistencies if not handled properly. Collision resolution techniques are employed to manage such occurrences and ensure the integrity and efficiency of hash-based data structures.

Techniques for Collision Resolution:
Chaining: In chaining, each hash table entry points to a linked list of items that hash to the same location. This method allows multiple items to exist at the same location in the hash table.

Open Addressing: Unlike chaining, open addressing resolves collisions by finding an alternative location within the hash table when a collision occurs. This often involves probing techniques such as linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing.

Robin Hood Hashing: This technique aims to maintain a more uniform distribution of items in the hash table by stealing from rich (longer) slots to give to poor (shorter) ones, minimizing the variance in probing lengths.

Importance:
Understanding hashing and collision resolution is crucial for designing efficient data structures and algorithms. It impacts the performance and reliability of systems handling large datasets, ensuring fast retrieval and minimal data loss.

Conclusion:
In this repository, we explore various hashing techniques and collision resolution strategies, demonstrating their applications and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. By studying and implementing these concepts, we gain insights into optimizing data storage and retrieval processes, enhancing the efficiency and robustness of our software systems.
